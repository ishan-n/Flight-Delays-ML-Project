# Flight-Delays-ML-Project
The project aims to predict whether a flight at the Chicago O'Hare International Airport will get delayed for more than 15 minutes based on the following variables:
Airport (Previous airport and Departing Airport)
Weather details of the Departing Airport
Airport & Airline Operations
Time, Day, and Month of departure
We are choosing only the said airport for our model as the airport is notoriously known for it's delays and lack of resources for airport operations. We believe with our model it could be possible to predict whether a flight that is departing from or arriving to the Chicago O'Hare International Airport will get delayed by 15 minutes or not. Our objective is to build a classification model that can reduce the prediction errors for predicting the flight delays and also the cost of predicting non delays when delays are actually happening.
